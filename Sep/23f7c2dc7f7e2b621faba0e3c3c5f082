It promised to provide the reasons for dismissing the Ford-People suit later.The tribunal also lifted previously issued temporary orders that had stopped the merger after Ford-People filed their case. email print email print Job boycott should be suspended to allow room for talks this week, judge rules. 32 million chickens in Kenya at risk of contracting the avian flu, Agriculture minister says.
