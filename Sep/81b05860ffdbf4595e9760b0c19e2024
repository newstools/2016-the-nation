The search for a Chief Justice resumed Tuesday morning, with the Judicial Service Commission interviewing Lucy Wanja Julius, a legal adviser to the Land Cabinet secretary.If she becomes Chief Justice, the media will have a rough time covering the courts after she promised to kick them out from proceedings. Ms Julius said the media are a threat to judges' independence as their coverage of cases may create the perception of bias when sentences are issued. She said she would have to consult litigants on whether they want their cases covered by the press.Her suitability for Chief Justice was also questioned as the panel sought to know her distinction in legal practice.The panel also asked why her application had gaps, including failing to submit all required documents, such as income-declaration forms for the past three years.Ms Julius said she would call for the vetting of junior judicial staff to end corruption. She said she would automate court processes in major towns within one year, adding that in five years she will have achieved an efficient and corruption-free Judiciary. email print email print Job boycott should be suspended to allow room for talks this week, judge rules. 32 million chickens in Kenya at risk of contracting the avian flu, Agriculture minister says.
