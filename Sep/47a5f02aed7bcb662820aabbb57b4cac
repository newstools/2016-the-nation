LONDONWorld heavyweight champion Tyson Fury's rematch with Wladimir Klitschko will take place in Manchester on October 29.Fury claimed a shock win over Ukrainian Klitschko to take the WBA, WBO and IBF belts in Dusseldorf last November.The 28-year-old British fighter agreed to face Klitschko again, which meant he was stripped of the IBF title for failing to face its mandatory challenger.A July date for the return bout was postponed after Fury suffered an ankle injury and Klitschko recently revealed he intended to go to court over the negotiations of a rematch with the controversial Fury.However, following Wednesday's announcement of the rematch, Klitschko wrote on Twitter: "Finally the rematch is fixed. I'll remedy my mistake on Oct. 29 at Manchester Arena. See you there! #NowMoreThanEver."Shortly after Fury postponed the original date, reports emerged that he had been the subject of a doping investigation last year.Fury denied the allegations but in August UK Anti-Doping revealed he had been provisionally suspended in June over the presence of a prohibited substance.The ban had been lifted pending an independent hearing and Fury, repeatedly in trouble for a series of controversial interviews since beating Klitschko, has been back in training since August. email print email print Job boycott should be suspended to allow room for talks this week, judge rules. 32 million chickens in Kenya at risk of contracting the avian flu, Agriculture minister says.
