The Orange Democratic Movement's disciplinary committee has recommended the expulsion of 13 politicians from the party.The team accuses them of violating the law and the party s constitution.The politicians include two governors, one deputy governor, 10 MPs and an undisclosed number of members of county assemblies from across the country.Committee chairman Fred Athuok, in a statement on Tuesday, said the panel had given a green light to the party s National Executive Council (NEC) to expel the leaders.They include Governors Ukur Yatani (Marsabit) and Salim Mvurya (Kwale), Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, Kwale Woman Representative Zainabu Chidzuga and MPs Steven Kariuki (Mathare), Mpuri Aburi (Tigania East), Gideon Mung aro (Kilifi North), Mustafa Iddi (Kilifi South), Cyprian Kubai (Igembe Central), Isaac Mwaura (nominated), James Rege (Karachuonyo), Samuel Arama (Nakuru Town) and John Waluke (Sirisia).The leaders have expressed their interest in working with the governing Jubilee coalition. These leaders have by conduct or statement indicated their intention to defect from the party by expressly attending the overt functions and activities of other political parties, that under section 14 (5) (c) of the Political Parties Act, the disciplinary committee deems such a member to have defected from the party, Mr Athouk said. The statement is also copied to the party's NEC, the Registrar of Political Parties, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal.Edited by Philip Momanyi email print email print Job boycott should not take off to allow room for talks this week, judge rules.
