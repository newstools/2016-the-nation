The Senate will hold public hearings over the impeachment of Nyeri Governor Nderitu Gachagua next week.Lawmakers will hold the hearings for three days starting Tuesday. Speaker Ekwee Ethuro also barred senators from commenting on Mr Gachagua s removal from office.The lawmakers had been asked to break their month-and-a-half-long recess and present themselves in the House to decide on how to handle the impeachment, the fourth in the Senate's four-year history. The Senate s Rules and Business Committee, chaired by Speaker Ethuro, met on Tuesday afternoon and agreed on the special sittings. The committee normally sets the business for the House. Mr Gachagua is the fourth governor to be recommended for impeachment by ward representatives and as has happened previously, he will likely face a special Senate committee that will delve into the accusations before making recommendations to the full House. Of the last three, only Embu Governor Martin Wambora was found guilty of the accusations against him and his impeachment was confirmed. He, however, contested the decision in court and his impeachment was quashed. Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony and his Murang a counterpart Mwangi Wa Iria kept their jobs after the accusations against them were dropped by the senators. email print email print Job boycott should be suspended to allow room for talks this week, judge rules. 32 million chickens in Kenya at risk of contracting the avian flu, Agriculture minister says.
