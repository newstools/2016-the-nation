The Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) has raised concern about the rising cases of aircraft accidents, saying it is looking into ways to reduce them. In the past three weeks, four aircraft have crashed in the Kenyan airspace, killing one person.Two of the aircraft, a Bell 206 and an Augusta A139, both helicopters, belonged to the police, one was owned by Ninety Nine Flying Club, based at Wilson Airport, and the other was private civilian plane. The outcome of the accident investigations will greatly assist in mitigation measures that will be shared with all operators and flying crew, the KCAA said.The KCAA said the accidents involving the two civilian aircraft were being investigated by the Air Accident Investigation Department of the Ministry of Transport.However, Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery will gazette a commission to investigate the police chopper crashes. email print email print Job boycott should be suspended to allow room for talks this week, judge rules. 32 million chickens in Kenya at risk of contracting the avian flu, Agriculture minister says.
