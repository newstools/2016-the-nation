The USA track team alone had four designated press attaches in Rio, said the report, adding that the Nock communication department should have seasoned media experts with a fine grasp of the Olympic events and Kenyan athletes.The report suggests the Kenyan Olympic steering committee should consider making it a constant to have at least five journalists from different media houses in Team Kenya s media pool and that the Sports Journalists Association of Kenya can be useful in selecting such journalists.Further Nock and Team Kenya are advised to consider reprimanding athletes who blatantly refuse to speak to the media as an obligation.
