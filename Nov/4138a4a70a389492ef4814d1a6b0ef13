During a recent party management committee meeting, Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale who has been named deputy party leader made it clear that the party intended to expel the trio for disobeying the Ford Kenya constitution.He explained that they had narrowed on the three because of their continued defiance of the party on whose ticket they were elected to Parliament."We have resolved that we create a disciplinary committee that should look into the conduct of some of our members that has been contrary to the constitution of Ford Kenya," said the Kakamega senator.The party has however failed to explain why similar summonses are not being extended to other MPs who were elected on Ford Kenya s ticket but have since defected to ODM, a sister party in the Cord coalition.They include Kisumu West MP Olago Aluoch and Awendo s Jared K Opiyo.
