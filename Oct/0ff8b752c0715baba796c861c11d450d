Corazone Aquino struck a first-half winner as Harambee Starlets edged out Egypt 1-0 in an international friendly match at Safaricom Stadium, Kasarani on on Friday.The match, which was Starlet s last build up match on home soil ahead of the Africa Women s Cup of Nations, was settled in the 35th minute after Aquino beat Egypt goalkeeper Engy Ahmed with a stunning shot.Both teams started cautiously, but Starlets were more enterprising in those opening moments although runs by forwards Mary Kinuthia and Esse Akida ended up fruitless as they lacked the precision to rattle the Egyptian rear-guard. Coach David Ouma made one change to the team that lost to Cameroon in another friendly on Saturday as his charges step up their preparations ahead of their Cup of Nations bow.With star striker Neddy Atieno unavailable, Ouma started with Aquino upfront, and the Spedag forward repaid the coach's faith with a beautiful strike 10 minutes to the break.Aquino was at the end of skipper Mary Kinuthia pass before she rifled home for the opener.Kinuthia was particularly impressive in this match, making several runs on the right to keep the Egypt s back-four on the back foot.Throughout the first half, Egypt had only two shots on target with Kenyan goalkeeper Samantha Akinyi untroubled for long spells in the match. Egypt s Faiza Hidar however showed flashes of brilliance as the Kenyans put up a dominant display.Ouma said that this result would serve to give the team more confidence going forward. "I would like to congratulate the players for being brave throughout the game. Against Cameroon, we were a bit anxious but the fact that we have won today shows that we are bridging the gap, Ouma said, whose side face defending champions Nigeria, Mali and Ghana in Group B at the Nations Cup."It is however unfortunate that we don't have a number of our impact players like Neddy (Atieno), although it is encouraging to see every player stepping up to fill in the gap."
