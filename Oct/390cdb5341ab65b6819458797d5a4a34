Home player Patrick Kingori grabbed a one shot lead after the close of round two in the ongoing Kenya Amateur Strokeplay Championship at the par-72 Thika Sports Club course Friday.Starting the morning round with five over par 77, Kingori now playing handicap two, had an excellent outward nine firing two back to back birdies on the second and third holes, dropped a shot at the fifth but picked up two more birdies at the seventh and eighth to cross to the back nine on three under. This was not as good as at the back nine as a double bogey at the short-hole 11th, 12th, 17th and 18th, with only a birdie at the 15th saw him out with four over par for one over 73 and a two rounds total of six over par 150.Kingori was a shot better than Vet Lab s Robinson Owiti, who bogeyed five holes at the first nine against a birdie and an eagle three-at the ninth. Owiti then dropped three shots at the back nine with two birdies. The course generally is in its best condition save for some of the greens which are very hard and tricky, said Owiti. It s very difficult to stop the ball on your approach shots though some four new greens are very nice, but we will see how it goes, added Owiti who bounced back to the national team which is heading to Ethiopia for the East Africa Challenge Cup after finishing sixth in the team trial. Nyali Golf and Country Club s Daniel Nduva was third after firing one over par 73 in the second round for 152. My game is not bad, just that had a bad start on Thursday, but I will recover, said Nduva, who was three over after the first nine of the afternoon s third round.Nduva tied in third place with three others who included Golfer of The Year defending champion John Karichu of Limuru, Kenya Railway Golf Club s Samuel Njoroge and Paul Muchangi of Limuru. Karichu carded three over par 75 while Njoroge fired 74 and Muchangi was on 77. Round one leader Dennis Saikwa had an awful outing, firing 84 to drop out of the leaderboard with 156 along with Railway s Alfred Nandwa and Anthony Kinuthia. The fourth and final round of the 72-hole event being sponsored by the Kenya Golf Union, is set for Saturday from 8am.
